Throughput is a valuable and important metric when it comes to load testing since it is crucial for 1) performance evaluation and 2) system capability and scalability assessment. 

For performance, throughput provides insight into the system's performance under heavy load by measuring the rate of processing, e.g. indicates how many transactions the system can handle within a given time. High throughput indicates that the system can efficiently handle a large volume or requests, while a low throughput indicates that the system cannot. Analyzing throughput during load testing can help testers identify performance limitations and optimize system components to improve system efficiency.

For system assessment, throughput metrics help determine the system's maximum capacity that it can handle during high load and identify the point at which the system reaches maximum throughput without degradation in performance. By monitoring throughput metrics, testers can assess the system's scalability and determine whether additional resources are necessary to accommodate higher loads. Thus, throughput provides crucial insights to the system's ability to scale and helps organizations make decisions regarding resource investment.
